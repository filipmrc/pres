\begin{frame}{Discussion}{Force feedback}
	
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The EndoWrist's highly nonlinear nature made the modelling a challenge
		\item The yaw (grip) force model has a delay of 0.2 s 
		\item The pitch model has a tendency to overestimate force
		\item An improved dynamic model could be used with a the implemented Kalman filter for state estimation and reference following
	\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Discussion}{Communication}


  \begin{itemize}
  	\item The maximum communication frequency of 385 Hz did not reach the 500 Hz goal.
  	\item New encoding  decreased packet size by 85\%
  	\item UDP omits unnecessary retransmission
  	\item Compression algorithms could further improve the communication frequency

  	
   
  \end{itemize}
