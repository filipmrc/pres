\begin{frame}{Discussion}{Force feedback}
	
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The EndoWrist's highly nonlinear nature made the modelling a challenge
		\item The grip model implemented provide a good estimate of the force but has a delay of 0.2 s 
		\item The pitch model does not provide an acceptable estimation of the force when implemented due to velocity measurements
		%\item The simulated two inputs model could be used with the implemented Kalman filter however this requires gathering new data sets
		\item The model that take velocity and current as inputs can be used to improve force feedback however this requires gathering new data sets
		%\item An improved dynamic model could be used with the implemented Kalman filter for state estimation and reference following
	\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Discussion}{Communication}


  \begin{itemize}
  	%\item New encoding  decreased packet size by 85\%
  	\item Compression algorithms, code optimization and real-time system could further improve the communication frequency
   
  \end{itemize}
