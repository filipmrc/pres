\begin{frame}{Discussion}{Force feedback}
	
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The EndoWrist's highly nonlinear nature made the modelling a challenge
		\item The yaw (grip) force model implemented has a delay of 0.2 s 
		\item The pitch model does not provide an acceptable estimation of the force when implemented
		\item The simulated two inputs model could be used with the implemented Kalman filter however this requires gathering new data sets
		%\item An improved dynamic model could be used with the implemented Kalman filter for state estimation and reference following
	\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Discussion}{Communication}


  \begin{itemize}
  	\item The maximum communication frequency of 385 Hz did not reach the 500 Hz goal.
  	\item New encoding  decreased packet size by 85\%
  	\item Compression algorithms, code optimization and real-time system could further improve the communication frequency
   
  \end{itemize}
