\frametitle{State estimation}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Modeling for additional outputs allows correction of the model using an estimator
    \item  A multiple output model that adequatley captures the dynamics of the system could be used in a Kalman filter to create a state estimate
    \item The state estimates can be used in a state feedback loop to change system dynamics
    \item Reference following capabilities can be added to the system, despite the nonlinear characteristics of the dynamics
  \end{itemize}

\frametitle{State estimation}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The hypothesis was tested in simulation
    \item Simulation results show that full reference following is possible despite the input nonlinearities in the system
    \item While the transient behaviour of the reference value is replicated, offsets and parasitic gains need to be compensated
    \item Could be implemented with improved model, doesn't improve estimate of current one.
    \end{itemize}
